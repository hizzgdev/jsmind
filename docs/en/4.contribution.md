Ask questions or contribute ideas

Or you can bring up a problem or need you've encountered via an issue for discussion, and hopefully a friend who has the ability and energy to join in and solve the problem together.

For common requirements, it is recommended to implement post-implementation feedback to the open source project, for non-common requirements, you can fork out a separate warehouse for custom development.
