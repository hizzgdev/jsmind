<!--
我们调整了创建 issue 的策略，仅在它确实是个 issue 的时候再创建 issue，其它情况请稳步到 Discussion 区创建 discussion.

- 这些是 issue: 明确的bug，非预期的结果，安全风险等
- 这些不是 issue: 咨询如何实现某一功能，讨论想法等

We have changed the policy of creating issues, please make sure that it is indeed an issue before creating it, in other cases, please go to Discussion tab to create a discussion.
- These are issues: clear bugs, unexpected results, security risks, etc.
- These are not issues: consultation on how to implement a certain function, discussion of new ideas, etc.
